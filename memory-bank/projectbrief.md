# Project Brief: Production Apps Suite

## üéØ Project Overview
**Production Apps Suite** is a comprehensive multi-page web application designed to manage production workflows for a custom printing business. The system handles order processing, production tracking, quality control, and shipping coordination across multiple facilities.

## üìã Core Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Centralized Production Management** - Single platform for all production-related activities
2. **Multi-Facility Support** - Handle operations across CHICO and OUTPOST facilities  
3. **Real-Time Tracking** - Live production stage updates and progress monitoring
4. **Role-Based Access** - Different interfaces for different user types
5. **Mobile Optimization** - Responsive design for tablets and mobile devices

### Technical Constraints
- **GitHub Pages Deployment** - Must work as static site with external APIs
- **N8N Integration** - All backend logic handled via N8N workflows
- **Airtable Database** - Primary data storage and management
- **No Server Requirements** - Pure client-side application

## üè≠ Business Context

### Facilities
- **CHICO**: Main facility with C2 printer
- **OUTPOST**: Secondary facility with D2, D6, U2, S2 printers

### Product Types
- DTF (Direct to Film)
- UV DTF 
- Sublimation
- Heat Press
- Embroidery
- Gang Sheets and Cutlines

### Production Stages
1. **Print** (0-25% completion)
2. **Quality Check** (25-50% completion)
3. **Cut** (50-75% completion)
4. **Ship** (75-100% completion)
