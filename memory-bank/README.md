## ðŸ”„ Usage Workflow

### Starting a New Session
1. **Read ALL Memory Bank files** (required - not optional)
2. Focus on `activeContext.md` for current priorities
3. Review `progress.md` for latest status
4. Check `projectbrief.md` if context is unclear

### During Development
1. Update `activeContext.md` with new decisions
2. Document technical patterns in `systemPatterns.md`
3. Track progress in `progress.md`
4. Update `techContext.md` for new technologies/tools

### After Major Changes
1. Update all relevant files
2. Ensure consistency across documents
3. Update project timelines and status
4. Document lessons learned and patterns

## ðŸ“Š Project Status Quick Reference

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ…
- **Status**: 100% Complete
- **Key Achievement**: Multi-page app structure with working production scanner
- **Deployment**: Ready for GitHub Pages

### Phase 2: Customer-Facing Apps ðŸ”„
- **Status**: Planned
- **Priority**: Status lookup and pickup confirmation
- **Timeline**: Next 2-3 weeks

### Current Focus
- **Immediate**: Deploy current structure to GitHub Pages
- **Next**: Build status lookup app for customers
- **Dependencies**: N8N webhook development

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Project Intelligence

### Critical Patterns
- **Multi-Page Architecture**: Chosen over SPA for role-based access
- **Shared Resources**: `config.js` and `styles.css` pattern works well
- **Mobile-First**: Production floor needs dictate tablet optimization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for network issues

### User Types & Priorities
1. **Production Floor Staff** - Scanner app (highest priority)
2. **Customer Service** - Status lookup (high priority)
3. **Operations Managers** - Queue monitor (medium priority)
4. **Management** - Metrics dashboard (lower priority)

### Technical Constraints
- **GitHub Pages**: Static site only, no server-side processing
- **N8N Integration**: All backend logic via webhooks
- **Mobile Performance**: Must work on production floor tablets
- **Airtable Database**: Primary data storage with specific schema

## ðŸ”§ Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Follow established patterns in `systemPatterns.md`
2. Use shared configuration from `config.js`
3. Maintain consistent UI with `styles.css`
4. Update Memory Bank documentation

### Code Quality Standards
- **JavaScript**: ES6+, async/await, consistent error handling
- **CSS**: CSS variables, mobile-first responsive design
- **HTML**: Semantic markup, accessibility considerations
- **Documentation**: Update Memory Bank after changes

### Testing Approach
- **Cross-browser**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- **Mobile devices**: iOS/Android tablets and phones
- **Production environment**: Actual facility testing
- **User workflows**: End-to-end validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance**: <2 second load times on mobile
- **Reliability**: <1% error rate in production
- **Adoption**: 100% staff usage of scanner app
- **Mobile Optimization**: 90% usage from mobile devices

### Business Impact
- **Visibility**: 100% improvement over paper tracking
- **Error Reduction**: 80% fewer manual mistakes
- **Processing Speed**: Baseline established for improvement
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from all user types

## ðŸš€ Future Evolution

### Planned Enhancements
- **Offline Capability**: Service worker for basic functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
- **Push Notifications**: Browser alerts for important events
- **Analytics Integration**: Advanced performance tracking

### Scalability Considerations
