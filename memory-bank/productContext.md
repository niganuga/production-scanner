# Product Context: Production Apps Suite

## üéØ Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
The custom printing business operates across multiple facilities (CHICO and OUTPOST) with complex production workflows involving various print types (DTF, UV DTF, Sublimation, Heat Press, Embroidery). Before this system:

1. **Manual Tracking** - Production stages tracked on paper or spreadsheets
2. **No Real-Time Visibility** - Customers and staff couldn't see live order status
3. **Facility Silos** - Different processes and tools at each location
4. **Quality Control Gaps** - Defects not systematically tracked or prevented
5. **Inefficient Resource Use** - No centralized view of equipment and capacity

### The Solution
**Production Apps Suite** provides a unified, digital platform that:
- **Centralizes Operations** - Single source of truth for all production activities
- **Enables Real-Time Tracking** - Live updates from production floor to customer
- **Standardizes Processes** - Consistent workflows across all facilities
- **Improves Quality** - Systematic defect tracking and prevention
- **Optimizes Resources** - Better visibility into capacity and bottlenecks
