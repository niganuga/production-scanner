#### 2. Status Lookup App (`status/`)
**Priority**: High - Customer-facing functionality
**Estimated Time**: 1 week
**Key Features**:
- Order search by ID or customer email
- Visual progress indicator showing current stage
- Estimated completion time display
- Clean, customer-friendly interface

#### 3. Pickup Confirmation App (`pickup/`)
**Priority**: High - Daily operations dependency
**Estimated Time**: 1 week
**Key Features**:
- List of ready-for-pickup orders
- Signature capture functionality
- Photo documentation option
- Pickup completion workflow

### Phase 2 Planning (Following 2-3 weeks)

#### Queue Monitor App (`queue/`)
**Purpose**: Live production queue management
**Key Features**:
- Real-time batch status display
- Drag-and-drop priority reordering
- Time estimates and capacity planning
- TV-friendly full-screen mode

#### Reprint Request App (`reprint/`)
**Purpose**: Defect reporting and reprint management
**Key Features**:
- QR code scanning for failed items
- Photo upload for defect documentation
- Defect categorization and tracking
- Priority override capabilities

## ðŸ“Š Current Metrics & KPIs

### Technical Performance
- **Page Load Time**: Target <2 seconds on mobile
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 100% tested on iOS/Android
- **API Response Time**: N8N webhooks averaging <500ms
- **Error Rate**: <1% target for production usage

### User Experience
- **Scanner Usage**: Production staff using tablets successfully
- **Dashboard Access**: Management checking stats regularly
- **Facility Switching**: Seamless facility management working
- **Mobile Interface**: Touch-friendly controls tested

### Development Velocity
- **Phase 1**: Completed in 1 sprint (infrastructure)
- **Code Quality**: Consistent patterns established
- **Documentation**: All major components documented
- **Testing**: Manual testing complete, automated testing planned

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Multi-Page Architecture**: Confirmed better than SPA for role-based access
2. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Static site approach validated
3. **Shared Resources**: Common CSS/JS approach working well
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Production floor feedback positive

### Pending Decisions
1. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket vs polling for live data
2. **Offline Capability**: Service worker implementation priority
3. **Push Notifications**: Browser notifications vs email alerts
4. **Data Caching**: Local storage vs session storage strategy

### User Feedback Integration
- **Production Staff**: Requesting larger touch targets (implemented)
- **Management**: Want quick stats on dashboard (implemented)
- **Customer Service**: Need faster order lookup (planned for Phase 2)
- **QC Team**: Want photo upload for defects (planned for Phase 2)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load app-specific resources
- **Image Optimization**: Compress images for mobile
- **CSS Minification**: Reduce stylesheet size
- **CDN Usage**: Consider for production deployment

### Security Measures
- **API Security**: All sensitive operations via N8N
- **Local Storage**: Only facility preferences stored
- **HTTPS**: All webhook communications encrypted
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for better UX

### Scalability Planning
- **Component Reusability**: Consistent patterns for new apps
- **Configuration Management**: Easy to add new facilities/printers
- **API Versioning**: Prepare for N8N webhook changes
- **Database Schema**: Airtable structure supports growth

## ðŸš¨ Current Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **N8N Dependency**: Single point of failure
  - *Mitigation*: Implement graceful degradation
- **GitHub Pages Limitations**: No server-side processing
  - *Mitigation*: Confirmed architecture works with constraints
- **Mobile Performance**: Complex interfaces on limited hardware
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing on actual devices

### User Adoption Risks
- **Change Management**: Staff used to paper processes
  - *Mitigation*: Gradual rollout, training sessions
- **Device Availability**: Need tablets for production floor
  - *Mitigation*: Responsive design works on phones as backup
- **Network Reliability**: Production depends on internet
  - *Mitigation*: Offline capabilities planned
